I've been using "Git":http://git-scm.com on and off for a while now and have found it to be an amazing tool. Now that I'm trying to increase my online presence, what better way than to start using it as the basis for my new blog.

I've read about Tom Preston-Werner's "Jekyll":http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master a while back and put it on my, all too long, list of things to investigate. Now I've decided to finally take it for a spin. The idea of having all of my posts in plain text, accessible via a git repository, instead of being locked away in some site's proprietary backend storage mechanism is very appealing.

Using Jekyll thus far has been simple and a real pleasure. The learning process has been quick and painless too. To get started all you need to do is get the requisite Ruby gems installed, set up a basic skeleton directory structure, and follow some simple conventions. There are also a number of "existing":http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll/sites Jekyll-based sites to mine some information and ideas from.
